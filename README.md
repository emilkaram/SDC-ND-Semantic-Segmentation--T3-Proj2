# Introduction:
In this project, I labeled the pixels of a road in images using a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN)

# Setup
GPU: main.py will check to make sure you are using GPU
if you don't have a GPU on your system, you can use AWS or another cloud computing platform.

# Frameworks and Packages
Make sure you have the following is installed:

Python 3
TensorFlow
NumPy
SciPy

# Dataset
Download the Kitti Road dataset (http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_road.php) from here (http://www.cvlibs.net/download.php?file=data_road.zip). Extract the dataset in the data folder. This will create the folder data_road with all the training a test images.
